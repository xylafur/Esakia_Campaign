# Recap

An agreement had been broken, instead of the goblins killing us, we were to be
killed on the front lines

We got in a cairage with don the mon of the hundred hon clon

We were making our way though goblin pass.  Jackson and Ray were in the
cairrage with don the mon drinking his higher being ball sweat and eating
caviar

Seems like it was gonna take at least 2 days.. I will be resting for these 2
days because I'm exausted


Jackson meditates (what a nerd) with the pact that he has made with his weapon.
The name of his weapon is "xandria" it is a curved one handed sword type yeah.

Jackson admitted that he was the least intelligent out of all of us, direct
quote on the record.



# Current day

We all get magically healed by wolvorine.

I pee into sean's canteen.  Sean realizes its me.  I say don't slut shame me.

We go throough a pass with caves off to our right.



## Conversation between Jackson and Don man
Jackson asks him how he got into bed with the goblins.

He replies "I made an offer they couldn't refuse and then took as much as I
wanted"

Jackson is like, yo what u talking about.

Don the Mon says "I'm a cool influential noble and people don't wanna be on my
bad side"

Jackson is like "we all gonna die"

Don thinks that people like us, the undying, are good fighter / bodyguards

because we can't die.

Jackson keeps pressing

Don says goblins like magic items and warriors.  THey don't have tactics
though, don sells them tactics for magic items.

Don is a commander of "many things"

Jackson trying to talk good to don, he thinks they gonna be good friends.

Don offers to do business with us, he wants an elixer of some sort, jackson
asks what he could do for us.

There are magic items in the cart we are in.



## We get to the end of the pass

We see a bunch of trenches with hob goblins with chain mail and spears.

They are like "Halt! Who goes there?"
Don the Mon says something suave and they open the gates.

After we pass through the gates, we see a small town.
Everything seems to be made of brick and tile.  Its strange though, because
even though its day (night is coming on) the entire city is covered in shadow.

** There are cherry trees everywhere.  **

As we go thorugh, there are guards everywhere.  Don the mon hands something to
a hob goblin guard as we pass by

He hands them gold.

## Night comes?
There is a rush across our cairages and the entire city is engulfed in darkness.

** Sean can now hear when it turns dark **
Sean lights up a torch as to not hear darkness

We are making our way though the main street.  We appear to be heading towards
the center of the town.

We go past a bunch of dead goblin and drow bodies.  None of the stores seems to
be open or anything

As we continue, a bunch of the houses have broken down doors and windows.  We
see a lot of war tents.


## The Drow Appear

Don knocks on th efront of his caairage to tell the driver to stop.  We stop
and then out of no where we are surrounded by dark elves.


Sean and I get out.  

Sean walks out and he's like "Does any body peak english?" A hand covers his
mouth.

I ask them if they are the enimies of the goblins in
elvish... bad idea.  They held a knife to my throat and then don the mon was
able to convince them to not kill me.

Don the mon says "these are my body guards"

Sean is then like "Hey we're here to help warlord zu right?"

well cassie and sean and I have to fight the drow...



Jackson goes and tells Don The Mon that there is a goblin in our cairrage



### We have to roll for something.. not sure what

Cassie, sean and I

Dex saving throw

Cassie is outlined in purple light, she sheds light in a 10 foot radius.

2 crosbow bolts hit cassie, one hits sean, one misses me

# Everyone roll initiative
Ray :       13
Sean:       20
Jackson:    16
Kes:        3
Cassie:     7


Sean starts to cry.
Jackson sits in the cart.
Ray talks to don the man.. don says basically we fucked.  Shitting bricks
Cassie runs into the cart without boo.  It is glowing purple

I run around the cairage, try to tackle sean, fail, and then punch him in the
mouth for 2 damage.

12 crossbow bolts fly in at sean, 5 hit him.
Sean falls to the ground, and turns to ash.  The glowing ash slowly begins to
fade away.

I kick at sean's ashes.

# After combat

THey are banging on the first and last cart.

Jackson opens the door on his cart.

They're asking us "Whats the meaning of all this"
Jackson and Ray play dumb.

## We have a meeting with the drow

I chain boo up and lead him in like my gimp

They take us into a building.

There is a big burly looking strong dark elf guy
He pulls back a veil and we see a very femminie looking elf lady
"SO like, what do yall need, I'm kinda busy right now"

Don says (leaning over to artifaxian): "Prove your worth"

Artie walks up to he and tries to be suave

THe drow are planning to flank from behind the mountains

We tell them about the town we wiped out

THey want to kill the elves and the dragon

We are trying to haggle for for information

There are 3 towers, a fort thing to the north, and one to the north west

They went to all of the cities to the north, they didn't find any elves or
dragons there

They tell us basically bring the sword to not kill us and give us anything
worth while

I'm trying to see if they would let us bring back drow bodies to act like we
killed all of the drow

We get to bring back the drow bodies, but we have to replace them with twice as
many hob goblin bodies.  We also have to bring back the dragon sword
